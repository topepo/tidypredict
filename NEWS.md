# tidypredict (development version)

# tidypredict 0.3.0

## New features

- Adds support for MARS models provided by the `earth` package

## Improvements

- New parsed models are now list objects as opposed to data frames.

- tidypredict_to_column() no longer supports `ranger` and `randomForest` because of the multiple queries generated by multiple trees.

- All functions that read the parsed models and create the tidy eval formula now use the list object.  

- Most of the code that depends on dplyr programming has been removed.

- Removes dependencies on: tidyr, tibble

- The `x/y` interface for `earth` models can now be used. 

## Bug Fixes

- It now returns all of the trees instead of just one for tree based models (`randomForest` & `ranger`) (#29)
